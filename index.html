			<p>The Dawgs may not look amazing at the moment, but there is potential for this team to bring home some hardware in the near future.</p>
			<p> Kirby Smart's first year in Athens has not been particularly stunning. We lost a homecoming matchup against an extremely weak Vandy team. We had a close call against a poor FCS opponent, Nicholls State. Also, we had a last second nail biter win against a relatively weak Kentucky team. So it is obvious that <b>SOMETHING</b> needs to change.</p> 
			<p> This <b>CHANGE</b> will be seen in the next two or three years, due to <i> one fact alone.</i> This is a young team. The Dawgs have a pretty dominate defense, but it is also the youngest defense in the conference. And the offense is young also. In the table below I provided a list of young stars that will be leading our team to do something grat in the folowing years. These are some tough playmakers that I cannot wait to see in the years to come. Below are a few of the freshman stars to look out for with their statistics through the first 9 games.</p>
		<table id="t01" border="4" class="center">
		<tr>
			<th>Freshman Elites</th><th>Total Yards</th><th>Average Yards</th><th>Touchdowns</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Brian Herrien RB</td><td>347</td><td>6.3</td><td>3</td>
		<tr>
			<td>Isaac Nauta WR</td><td>253</td><td>12.7</td><td>2</td>
		<tr>
			<td>Riley Ridley WR</td><td>140</td><td>17.5</td><td>2</td>
		<tr>
			<td>Jacob Eason QB</td><td>1754</td><td>12.1</td><td>11</td>
		</table>
			<p> Along with these young stars, the dawgs have a couple other things to be optimistic about: </p>
			 <ol id="l01">
  				<li>We have yet another stunning recruitment class for 2017</li>
 				<li>The offensive line woes of this season will soon be over as a large freshman class is stepping in to compete</li>
				<li>Kirby Smart needs more than one year to turn the program around</li>
			</ol>
			<p> Let's keep our heads up!! GO DAWGS!! </p>
